Containts the codes of the website I am creating as a part of my course program in the university non Nantes.

The website is being created as a project in course program called Industrial Project.

The website is trying to make a pleasant environemnt for the ones who want to learn science, either laypersons and non-especialists or
specialists. The websoite is not an environment for interchange between specialists, neither it is a place to present courses to the ones who want to learn science, but it is a place were specialists will answer the newbies in different domains of science.
