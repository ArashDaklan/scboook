Containts the codes of the website I am creating as a part of my course program in the university of Nantes.

The website is being created as a project in course program called Industrial Project.

The website is trying to make a pleasant environemnt for the ones who want to learn science, either laypersons and non-especialists or
specialists. The websoite is not an environment for interchange between specialists, neither it is a place to present courses to the ones who want to learn science, but it is a place were specialists will answer the questiions asked by newbies in different domains of science.
The new students in any domain ask sometimes questions that are niot too clear for specialists. These questions are generally being neglected when asked in the forums dedicated to interchage among specialists.

Laypersons interested in science are generally refused by specialists and in result what they get is a fictive and distorted vision of different domains of science. This website aims to base a good environment for interaction between specialists and non-especialists in science.
